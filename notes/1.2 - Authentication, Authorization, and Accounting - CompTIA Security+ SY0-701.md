# Authenticating Systems

## You have to manage many devices
- Often systems you can't see

## A system can't type a password
- You may not want to store one

## How do you truly authenticate a devices
- Digitally signed certificate

## Other business processes rely on the certificate
- Access to the VPN from authorized devices
- Management software can validate end devices

# Certificate Authentication

## An organization has a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
- Most orgs maintain their own CA

## The org creates a certificate for a devices
- It digitially signs the cert with the org's CA

## The certificate can now be included on a device as an authentication factor
- The CA's digital signature is used to validate the certificate

## Certificate Authority has its own certificate signed by a Root CA

# Authorization Models

## User is now authenticated
- What access do they have
- Time to apply an authorization model

## Users and services -> Data and applications
- Associating individual users to access rights does not scale

## Put an authorization model in the middles
- Define by Roles, Organizations, Attributes, etc.

## No authorization model
- A simple relationship
- User > Resource
- Issues with this method
- Difficult to understand why an authorization may exist
- Does not scale

## Using an authorization model

### Add an abstraction
- Reduce complexity
- Create a clear relationship between the user and the resource

### Administration is streamlined
- Easy to under the authorizations
- Support any number of users or resources
