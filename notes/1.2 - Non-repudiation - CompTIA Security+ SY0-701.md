[ Non-repudiation - CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 - 1.2 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxnCxPEllMg)

# Non-repudiation

- You can't deny what you've said
- There's no taking it back

- Sign a contract
- Your signature adds "non-repudiation"
- You really did sign the contract
- Others can see your signature

- Adds a different perspective for cryptography
- Proof of integrity
- Proof of origin, with high assurance of authenticity

## Proof of integrity

- Verify data does not change
- Data is accurate and consistent
- Nothing was changed

### In cryptography, we use a hash

- Represent data as a short string of text
- A message digest, a fingerprint

### If data changes, the hash changes

- If the person changes, you get a different fingerprint

### Does not necessarily associate data with an individual

- Only tells you if the data has been changed

### Hashing a file

- Changing one character in a file changes the hash

## Proof of Origin

- Authentication
- Make sure the signature isn't fake
- Sign with a private key
- Message doesn't need to be encrypted
- No one else can sign it
- Verify with the public key associated with the private key
