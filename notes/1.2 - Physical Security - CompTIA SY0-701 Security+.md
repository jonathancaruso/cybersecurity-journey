## Barricades / Bollards

### Prevent access
- There are limits to the prevention

### Channel people through a specific access point
- Keep out other things
- Allow people, prevent cars and trucks

### Identify safety concerns
- Prevent injuries

### Specialized design
- Consider overall light levels
- Lighting angles may be important
- Important for facial recognition
- Avoid shadows and glare

## Sensors

### Infrared
- Detects infrared radiation in both light and dark
- common in motion detectors

### Pressure
- Detects a change in force
- Floor or window sensors

### Microwave
- Detects movement over large areas

### Ultrasonic
