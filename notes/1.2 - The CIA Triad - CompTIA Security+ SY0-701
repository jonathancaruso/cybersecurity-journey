Fundamentals of Security

## Confidentiality

### Encryption

- Encode messages so only certain people can read it

### Access Controls

- Selectively restrict access to a resource

### Two-factor Authentication
- Additional confirmation before info is disclosed

## Integrity

- Messages can't be modified without detection
- Data is stored and transferred as intended

### Hashing

- Map data of an arbitrary length to data of a fixed length

### Digital Signatures

- Mathematical scheme to verify integrity of data

### Certificates

- Combine with a digital signature to verify an individual

### Non-repudiation

- Provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine

## Availability

- Systems and network must be online and available

### Redundancy

- Build services that will always be available

### Fault Tolerance

- Able to handle failures and keep running

### Patching

- Stability
- Close security holes
