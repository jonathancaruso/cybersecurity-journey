# 1.2 - Zero Trust - CompTIA Security+ SY0-701

## Many networks are relatively open on the inside
- Once through the firewall, there are few security controls

## Zero Trust is a holistic approach to network security
- Covers every device, every process, every person on the network

## Everything must be verified
- Nothing is inherently trusted
- Multi-factor authentication, encryption, system permissions, additional firewalls, monitoring and analytics, etc.

## Planes of operation

### Split the network into functional planes
- Applies to physical, virtual, and cloud components

### Data plane
- Process the frames, packets, and network data
- Processing, forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT

### Control Plane
- Manages the actions of the data plane
- Define policies and rules
- Determines how packets should be forwarded
- Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables

## Extend the physical architecture

### Separate into functional tasks
- Incorporate into hardware or software

## Controlling trust

### Adaptive identity
- Consider the source and the requested resources
- Multiple risk indicators
	- relationship to the organization
	- physical location
	- type of connection
	- IP address
- Make the authentication stronger, if needed

### Threat scope reduction
- Decrease number of possible entry points

### Policy-driven access control
- Combine the adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules

## Security Zones

### Security is more than a one-to-one relationship
- Broad categorizations provide a security-related foundation

### Where are you coming from and where are you going?
- Trusted, Untrusted
- Internal network, extenal network
- VPN1, VPN5, VPN11
- Marketing, IT, Accounting, Human Resources

### Using the zones may be enough by itself to deny access
- For example, **Untrusted** to **Trusted**

### Some zones are implicitly trusted
- For example, **Trusted** to **Internal** zone traffic

## Policy enforcement point

### Subjects and systems
- End users, applications, non-human entities
Subject -> System -> Untrusted -> Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) -> Trusted -> Enterprise Resource

## Applying trust in the Planes

### Policy Decision point
- There's a process for making an authentication Decision

### Policy Engine
- Evaluates each access decision based on policy and other information sources
- Grant, deny, or revoke

### Policy Administrator
- Communicates with the Policy Enforcement Point
- Generates access tokens or credentials
- Tells the PEP to allow or disallow access

## Zero Trust Across Planes

Subject -> System -> Untrusted -> Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) -> Policy Decision Point (PDP): [Policy Engine/Policy Administrator] -> Trusted -> Enterprise Resource
