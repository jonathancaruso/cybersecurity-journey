# Change Management

## How to make a change
- Upgrade software
- Patch application
- Change firewall configuration
- Modify switch ports
- Requires formal process

## One of the most common risks in the enterprise
- Occurs very frequently
- Microsoft regular patching
- Many applications in use, all may have patching

## Often overlooked or ignored
- Did you feel that bite?

## Have clear policies
- Frequency
- Duration
- Installation process
- Rollback procedures

## Sometimes very difficult to impelment
- Hard to change corporate culture

# Change approval process

## A formal process for managing change
- Avoid downtime, confusion, mistakes

## A typical approval process
- Complete the request forms
- Determine the purpose of the change
- Identify the scope of the change
- Schedule the data and time of the change
- Determine affected systems and the impact
- Analyze the risk associated with the change
- Get approval from the change control board

# Ownership

## An individual or entity needs to make a change
- They own the process
- They don't (usually) perform the actual change

## Owner manages the process
- Process updates are provided to the owner
- Ensures the process is followed and acceptable

## Address label printers need to be upgraded
- Shipping and Receiving department owns the process
- IT handles the actual change

# Stakeholders

## Who is impacted by this change?
- They'll want to have input on the change management process

## This may not be obvious
- Single change can include one individual or the entire company

## Upgrade software used for shipping labels
- Shipping / Receiving
- Used for accounting reports
- Product delivery timeframes could be affected
- Revenue recognition - CEO visibility

# Impact Analysis

## Determine a risk value
- High, medium, low

## Risks can be minor or far-reaching
- The "fix" doesn't actually fix anything
- The fix breaks something else
- Operating system failures
- Data corruption

## What's the risk of NOT making the change?
- Security vulnerability
- Application unavailability
- Unexpected downtime to other services

# Test results

## Sandbox testing environment
- No connection to the real world or production system
- Technological safe space

## Use before making a change to production
- Try the upgrade, apply the patch
- Test and confirm before deployment

## Confirm the backout plan
- Move everything back to the original
- Sandbox can't consider every possibility

# Backout plan

## the change will work perfectly and nothing will ever go bad
- wrong

## You should always have a way to revert your changes
- Prepare for the worst, hope for the best

## This isn't as easy as it sounds
- Some changes are difficult to revert

## Always have backups
- Always have good backups
- Test backups regularly

# Maintenance window

## When is the change happening?
- This might be the most difficult part of the process

## During the workday may not be the best option
- Potential downtime would affect a large part of production

## Overnights are often a better choice
- Challenging for 24 hour production schedules

## Time of year may be a consideration
- Retail networks are often frozen during the holiday season

# Standard Operating Procedures

## Change management is critical
- Affects everyone in the organization

## The process must be well documented
- Should be available on the Intranet
- along with all standard processes and procedures

## Changes to the process are reflected in the standards
- A living document
