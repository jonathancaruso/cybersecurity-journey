#  Technical Change Management - CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 - 1.3 

# Technical Change Management

## Put the change management process into action
- Execute the plan

## There's no such thing as a simple upgrade
- Can have many moving parts
- Separate events may be required

## Change management is often concerned with "what" needs to change
- The technical team is concerned with "how" to change it

# Allow list / deny list

## Any application can be dangerous
- Vulnerabilities
- Trojan horses
- Malware

## Security policy can control app execution
- Allow list
- Deny/block list

## Allow list
- Nothing runs unless it's approved
- Very restrictive

## Deny list
- Nothing on the "bad list" can be executed
- Anti-virus, anti-malware

# Restricted activities

## The scope of change is important
- Defines exactly which components are covered

## A change approval isn't permission to make any change
- The change control approval is very specific

## The scope may need to be expanded during the change window
- It's impossible to prepare for all possible outcomes
- e.g. upgrading printer drivers requires updating configuration file on everyone's system

## The change manage process determines the next steps
- There are processes in place to make the change successful

# Downtime

## Services will eventually be unavailable
- The change process can be disruptive
- Usually scheduled during non-production hours

## If possible, prevent any downtime
- Switch to secondary system, upgrade the primary, then switch back

## Minimize any downtime events
- The process should be as automated as possible
- Switch back to secondary if issues appear
- Should be part of the backout plan

## Send emails and calendar updates

# Restarts

## It's common to require a restart
- Implement the new configuration
- Reboot the OS, power cycle the switch, bounce the service
- Can the system recover from a power outage?

## Services
- Stop and restart the service or daemon
- May take seconds or minutes

## Applications
- Close the application completely
- Launch a new application instance

# Legacy Applications

## Some applications were here before you arrived
- They'll be here when you leave

## Often no longer supported by the developer
- You are now the support team

## Fear of the unknown
- Face your fears and document the system
- It may not be as bad as you think

## May be quirky
- Create specific processes and procedures

## Become the expert

# Dependencies

## To complete A, you must complete B
- A service will not start without other active services
- An application requires a specific library version

## Modifying one component may require changing or restarting other components
- This can be challenging to manage

## Dependencies may occur across systems
- Upgrade the firewall code first
- Then upgrade the firewall management software

# Documentation

## It can be challenging to keep up with the changes
- Documentation can become outdated very quickly
- Require with the change management process

## Updating diagrams
- Modifications to network configurations
- Address updates

## Updating policies/procedures
- Adding new systems may require new procedures

# Version Control

## Track changes to a file or configuration data over time
- Easily revert to a previous setting

## Many opportunities to manage versions
- Router configurations
- Windows OS patches
- Application registry entries

## Not always straightforward
- Some devices and OS provide version control features
- May require additional management software
