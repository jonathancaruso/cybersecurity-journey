# Encrypting Data

## Protect data on storage devices
- SSD, hard drive, USB drive, cloud storage, etc.
- Encrypting data at rest

## Full-disk and partition/volume encryption
- Bitlocker (Windows), FileVault (MacOS), Veracrypt, etc.

## File encryption
- EFS (Encrypting File System), third party utilities
- Windows > file properties > Encrypt contents to secure Data

# Database encryption

## Protecting stored Data
- and the transmission of that Data

## Transparent encryption
- Encrypt all database information with a symmetric key

## Record-level encryption
- Encrypt individual columns
- Use separate symmetric keys for each column
- Overhead when encrypting/decrypting
- Saves time only encrypting what is necessary

# Transport Encryption

## Protect data traversing the network
- HTTPS - Secure web browsing

## Encrypting in the application
- HTTPS
- SFTP

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- Encrypts all data transmitted over the network, regardless of the application
- Client based VPN using SSL/TLS
- Site-to-site VPN using IPsec

# Encryption algorithms

## There are many, many different ways to encrypt Data
- The proper "formula" must be used during encryption and decryption

## Both sides decide on the algorithm before encrypting the Data
- Details are often hidden from the end user

## There are advantages and disadvantages between algorithms
- Security level
- Speed
- Complexity of implementation

# Cryptographic keys

## There's very little that isn't known about the Cryptographic process
- The algorithm is usually a known entity
- The only thing you don't know is the key

## The key determines the output
- Encrypting Data
- Hash value
- Digital signature

## Keep your key PRIVATE!
- It's the only thing protecting your Data

# Key lengths

## Larger keys tend to be more secure
- Prevent brute-force attacks
- Attackers can try every possible key combination

## Symmetric encryption
- 128-bit or larger symmetric keys are common
- These numbers get larger and larger as time goes on

## Asymmetric encryption
- Complex calculations of prime numbers
- Larger keys than symmetric encryption
- Common to see key lengths of 3072 bits or Larger

# Key stretching

## a weak key is a weak key
- By itself, not very secure

## Make a weak key stronger by performing multiple processes
- Hash a password
- Hash the hash of the password
- Hash the hash of the hash of the password, etc.
- Key stretching, key strengthening

## Brute force attacks would require reversing each of those hashes
- The attacker has to spend much more time, even though the key is small
