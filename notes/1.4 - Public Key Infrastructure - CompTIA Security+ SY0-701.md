# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## Policies, procedures, hardware, software, people
- Digital certificates: create, distribute, manage, store, revoke

## The is a big, big endeavor
- Lots of planning

## Also refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices
- The certificate authority
- All about trust

# Symmetric Encryption

## A single, shared key
- Encrypt with the key
- Decrypt with the key
- If it gets out, you'll need another key

## Secret key algorithm
- A shared secret

## Doesn't scale very well
- Can be challenging to distribute

## Very fast to use
- Less overhead than asymmetric encryption
- Often combined with asymmetric encryption

# Asymmetric Encryption

## Public Key Cryptography
- Two (or more) mathematically related keys

## Private key
- Keep this PRIVATE

## Public key
- Anyone can see this key
- Give it away

## The private key is the only key that can decrypt data encrypted with the public key
- You can't derive the private key from the public key

# The key pair

## Asymmetric encryption
- Public key cryptography

## Key generation
- Build both the public and private key at the same time
- Lots of randomization
- Large prime numbers
- Lots and lots of math

## Everyone can have the public key
- Only Alice has the private key

## Alice's key generation
Large random number > Key Generation Program > Alice's public key and Alice's private key

# Key Escrow

## Someone else holds your decryption keys
- Your private keys are in the hands of a third party
- This may be within your own organization

## This can be a legitimate business arrangement
- A business might need access to employee information
- Government agencies may need to decrypt partner data

## Controversial?
- Of course
- But still may be required
